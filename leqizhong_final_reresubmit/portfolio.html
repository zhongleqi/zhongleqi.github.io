          <p class="description">For years, even on hot mornings and afternoons, Verde Elementary School students have spent heir recess and physical education periods on a cracked and sun-drenched blacktop — a wide open space with colored lines drawing volleyball courts and soccer fields, a running track along the edge.</p>

          <p class="description">“I haven’t had a boat in stock for over a year, and we are waiting for boats coming in next year,” said Jacobsen, owner of The Outboard Motor Shop in Oakland. “Boat sales ever since July of 2020 have just gone crazy. Starting in June and July we sold out of all our boats.”</p>

          <p class="description">Thanksgiving is the busiest season for the crab restaurants around San Francisco's Pier 45. A single stall, Crab Station, was selling 500 pounds a day before the pandemic, even though it was surrounded by a row of competitors selling the same Dungeness crabs. “Now, 30 pounds if we’re lucky,” said Caroline Petitt, manager of Crab Station.</p>

          <h3>November 5, 2021</h3>
          <p class="description">Anyone who goes to Berkeley Marina will notice the bumpy roads, the stunning views, and the scarcity of food. The Marina complex comprises 60 acres of upland and 40 acres of water but has merely three restaurants, all with floor-to- ceiling windows facing the ocean and San Francisco skyline. But the only casual eating spot is nearly a mile from the waterfront, so visitors who don’t want sitdown dining must bring along their own food.</p>

          <h3>October 12, 2021</h3>
          <p class="description">Seabreeze Market & Deli, a family-owned diner on University Avenue near the entrance to the Berkeley Marina, has been serving crab cakes, burgers and fries to bikers and hikers for more than two decades. But its future is now in doubt, ironically at the same time a big neglected bayfront expansion project adjacent to it is finally getting an ambitious, long-awaited makeover.</p>
