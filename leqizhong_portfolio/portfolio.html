          <h3>October 4, 2023</h3>
          <p class="description">Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) is the world’s largest gathering of women and nonbinary tech professionals. Its goal is to improve inclusivity and equity in the tech industry. This year the event has been mired in controversy over complaints that cisgender men overran the conference. Some men have argued that the event unfairly discriminated against them by gender.</p>

          <h3>October 2, 2023</h3>
          <p class="description">A McDonald’s Japan advertisement featuring a family recently went viral on X. Although the ad presents a seemingly innocuous scene of a family eating a meal, some viewers mocked it as being homophobic, transphobic, and racist, and lashed out at artists who reimagined the scene.</p>

          <p class="description">Oakland’s Chinatown has been striving to recover the business that was lost during the pandemic and the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. The latest break-ins have dealt a severe blow to those efforts, leaving businesses and customers worried about being targeted and about the future of Chinatown.</p>

          <p class="description">Oakland’s Chinatown was transformed Sunday into a vibrant street market, where the aroma of cooking food mingled with the crackle of conversation and the bright colors of balloons and paper lanterns. Beneath a canopy of floating red lanterns, vendors hawked rib and radish soup, boba tea, and pineapple buns.</p>

The following interactive charts show the energy production mix from 1990 to 2019.

          <h3>November 10, 2022</h3>
          <p class="description">Facebook – like most social media – benefits from the protections that Section 230 offers platforms online. So then why is it advocating for Section 230 reform? This is the second episode of a UC Berkeley cross campus initiative called “Our Better Web.” This episode continues to consider the impact that Section 230 has had on the internet as we know it today. Today’s stories look into content moderation, algorithmic discrimination, and the legislation that has attempted – and is attempting – to change Section 230.</p>

          <p class="description">Anyone who goes to Berkeley Marina will notice the bumpy roads, the stunning views, and the scarcity of food. The Marina complex comprises 60 acres of upland and 40 acres of water but has merely three restaurants, all with floor-to- ceiling windows facing the ocean and San Francisco skyline. But the only casual eating spot is nearly a mile from the waterfront, so visitors who don’t want sitdown dining must bring along their own food.</p>

But its future is now in doubt, ironically at the same time a big neglected bayfront expansion project adjacent to it is finally getting an ambitious, long-awaited makeover.</p>
